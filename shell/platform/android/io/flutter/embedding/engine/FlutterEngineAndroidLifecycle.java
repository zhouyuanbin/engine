/**
 * Android {@link Lifecycle} that is owned by a {@link FlutterEngine}.
 * <p>
 * {@code FlutterEngineAndroidLifecycle} exists so that {@code FlutterPlugin}s can monitor Android
 * lifecycle events. When the associated {@link FlutterEngine} is running in an {@code Activity},
 * that {@code Activity}'s {@link Lifecycle} can be set as the {@code backingLifecycle} of this
 * class, allowing all Flutter plugins to receive the {@code Activity}'s lifecycle events. Likewise,
 * when the associated {@link FlutterEngine} is running in a {@code Service}, that {@code Service}'s
 * {@link Lifecycle} can be set as the {@code backingLifecycle}.
 * <p>
 * Sometimes a {@link FlutterEngine} exists in a non-lifecycle location, e.g., an {@code Application},
 * {@code ContentProvider}, or {@code BroadcastReceiver}. In these cases, this lifecycle reports
 * itself in the {@link Lifecycle.State#CREATED} state.
 * <p>
 * Regardless of what happens to a backing {@code Activity} or @{code Service}, this lifecycle
 * will only report itself as {@link Lifecycle.State#DESTROYED} when the associated {@link FlutterEngine}
 * itself is destroyed. This is because a {@link Lifecycle} is not allowed to emit any events after
 * going to the {@link Lifecycle.State#DESTROYED} state. Thus, this lifecycle cannot emit such an
 * event until its associated {@link FlutterEngine} is destroyed. This then begs the question, what
 * happens when the backing {@code Activity} or {@code Service} is destroyed? This lifecycle will
 * report the process up to the {@link Lifecycle.Event#ON_STOP} event, but will ignore the
 * {@link Lifecycle.Event#ON_DESTROY} event. At that point, this lifecycle will be back in its
 * default {@link Lifecycle.State#CREATED} state until some other backing {@link Lifecycle} is
 * registered.
