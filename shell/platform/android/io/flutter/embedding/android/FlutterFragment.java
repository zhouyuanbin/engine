/**
 * {@code Fragment} which displays a Flutter UI that takes up all available {@code Fragment} space.
 * <p>
 * WARNING: THIS CLASS IS EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT SHIP A DEPENDENCY ON THIS CODE.
 * IF YOU USE IT, WE WILL BREAK YOU.
 * <p>
 * Using a {@code FlutterFragment} requires forwarding a number of calls from an {@code Activity} to
 * ensure that the internal Flutter app behaves as expected:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link android.app.Activity#onPostResume()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link android.app.Activity#onBackPressed()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link android.app.Activity#onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[])} ()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link android.app.Activity#onNewIntent(Intent)} ()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link android.app.Activity#onUserLeaveHint()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link android.app.Activity#onTrimMemory(int)}</li>
 * </ol>
 * Additionally, when starting an {@code Activity} for a result from this {@code Fragment}, be sure
 * to invoke {@link Fragment#startActivityForResult(Intent, int)} rather than
 * {@link android.app.Activity#startActivityForResult(Intent, int)}. If the {@code Activity} version
 * of the method is invoked then this {@code Fragment} will never receive its
 * {@link Fragment#onActivityResult(int, int, Intent)} callback.
 * <p>
 * If convenient, consider using a {@link FlutterActivity} instead of a {@code FlutterFragment} to
 * avoid the work of forwarding calls.
 * <p>
 * If Flutter is needed in a location that can only use a {@code View}, consider using a
 * {@link FlutterView}. Using a {@link FlutterView} requires forwarding some calls from an
 * {@code Activity}, as well as forwarding lifecycle calls from an {@code Activity} or a
 * {@code Fragment}.
